This repository contains a Streamlit-based web application that allows users to upload documents (Excel .xlsx, PDF .pdf, or Word .docx) and ask questions about their content using an AI-powered question-answering system. It leverages semantic search (ChromaDB + sentence transformers) and Azure OpenAI's GPT-4 for generating contextual answers.
